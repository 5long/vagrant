Vagrant needs you!

We're trying to build something great to change the way developers work.
But we're just two guys, and we know there is a lot of growing up we have
to do! If you've got an idea, a bug report, or just want to dig in and hack
on Vagrant, you are welcome to!

Visit [Vagrant on GitHub](http://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant) to report any
issues or to grab the code to begin hacking.
