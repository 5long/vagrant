# A Full Example

For a full example on how to create a plugin, view the [vagrant-rake](http://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-rake)
plugin, which is a gem-based plugin which I created and use every day.
This plugin covers all portions of plugin creation, and serves as a great
example to build your own plugins from.

* New configuration
* New command
* Implemented via a new middleware stack
* I18n translated
* Automated test suite
