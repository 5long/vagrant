# Overview

The user guide is a set of documentation meant to both introduce and
explain in detail every portion of Vagrant and its uses. This guide
is hand-written instead of being generated from the Vagrant codebase.
If you're reading this guide on the Vagrant website, then we guarantee
it'll be up-to-date to the currently released gem version. Older versions
of the documentation can be extracted from the git repository, since each
release is tagged, including the documentation branch.

This guide goes through every aspect of Vagrant in great detail. If instead
you're more of the tinkering type and want to just get Vagrant up and running,
check out the [Getting Started](#) page instead.
