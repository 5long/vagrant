# Documentation

This portion of the site will be dedicated to documenting Vagrant
from top-to-bottom. If you're just getting started with Vagrant, we recommend
you first read the [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started/index.html).

<div class="warning">
  <strong>Work in progress!</strong> The documentation is a huge work in progress.
  While the getting started guide is fairly complete, the detailed documentation
  still has a long way to go. If you have questions, we recommend you check out the
  different methods of <a href="/support.html">support lines</a> we have.
