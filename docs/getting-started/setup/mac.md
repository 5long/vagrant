# Mac OS X

Mac OS X actually comes with Ruby and RubyGems built straight into the
operating system already. The only additional software you need to install
Vagrant is [Xcode](http://developer.apple.com/xcode/), which you can get
for free in the Mac App Store.

Also, you will want to update your Rubygems installation, since Vagrant
requires a slightly newer version than what is distributed with Mac OS X:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo gem update --system
{% endhighlight %}

Now just head back to the [getting started overview page](/docs/getting-started/index.html)
and continue with the guide!
